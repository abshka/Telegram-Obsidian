# --- Export Configuration ---

# Base directory where all exported notes and media will be stored
# Use absolute path for reliability
OBSIDIAN_PATH=/path/to/your/folder/

# Comma-separated list of target chat/channel IDs or usernames
# Examples: EXPORT_TARGETS="-100123456789, @mychannel, another_user_id, https://t.me/publicgroup"
# Leave empty to use interactive mode (if INTERACTIVE_MODE=true)

# If true: OBSIDIAN_PATH/channel_mychannel/notes...
# If false: OBSIDIAN_PATH/notes... (all mixed)
