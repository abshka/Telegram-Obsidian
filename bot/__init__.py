# This file makes the 'bot' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally define what is exported when 'from bot import *' is used:
# __all__ = ['main', 'config']

# Or import key components to make them available directly from the package:
# from .main import main_function_if_any
# from .config import BOT_TOKEN

# For now, it will be kept simple.
