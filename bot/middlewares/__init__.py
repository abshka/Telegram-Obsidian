# Middlewares for the Telegram bot
# This file makes Python treat the directory `middlewares` as a package.

# You can import specific middlewares here for easier access from other parts of the bot,
# for example:
# from .auth_middleware import AuthMiddleware

# For now, it's empty as we haven't defined any specific middlewares yet.
